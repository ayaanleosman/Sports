Navigation Plan
Homepage
basketball page, football page, boxing page, contact page, about page
total of 6 pages

development process
I used navigation bar for all the pages and used <li> tags to navigate through the different pages
In the CSS I used hover and opacity to add effect to the website
I also used social media widgets on the footer on every page
I used sections on all the pages on the website so the website looks well-structured
I have also used images and videos to the user a variety when taking in information
