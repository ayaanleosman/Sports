      <p>Our mission at SportsDaily is to make sure sports fans are up to date with sports the
       quickest way possible and not to waste their time. we offer hard-hitting news stories,
      summarised so the viewers do not miss anything with our bitesized stories. We also like to
         incorporate videos and images to tell a story because words alone can be a bore at times
         and images and videos can tell stories better than words at times. Many sports sites have
          more than 20 sports that they cover but we just focus on 3 and make sure we cover
           everything. we would want be the go-to website for Football, Boxing and Basketball rather
            than be mediocre but cover many sports.
